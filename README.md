# e-health 
e-Health is the delivery of health care using modern electronic information and communication 
technologies when health care providers and patients are not directly in contact and their interaction
is mediated by electronic means. Among other things, the services that are thus provided include physical 
and psychological diagnosis and treatment, telepathology, vital signs monitoring, electronic prescribing, 
teleconsultation, etc.
