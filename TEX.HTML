<h3>E-health</h3>
<p>
e-Health is the delivery of health care using modern electronic information and communication technologies when health care providers and patients are not directly in contact and their interaction is mediated by electronic means. Among other things, the services that are thus provided include physical and psychological diagnosis and treatment, telepathology, vital signs monitoring, electronic prescribing, teleconsultation, etc.This approach to health care is increasingly being employed in geographically extended areas where the availability of health care is severely reduced or even non-existent, and when appropriately qualified medical personnel are available only in a centralized location.

In eHealth, two significant factors have ethical relevance for the handling of EHRs. One is professional; the other is technical.

The technical factor is quickly dealt with. On the assumption that there is a fiduciary physician–patient relationship in eHealth, the ethical duties with respect to the handling of patient data in general and of EHRs in particular and that derive from the fiduciary relationship itself in standard health care also hold in eHealth. As in standard health care itself—and as was outlined in the preceding chapters—the realm of these duties would extend to include, derivatively, the HIPs and institutions that would be involving in this provision of eHealth by the physicians in question.
